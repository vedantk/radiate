Radiate
=======

Radiate is a primitive ray tracer, optimized for large triangle meshes. It
(will) support global illumination through radiosity.

To do
=====

- Radiosity solver
- Basic testing (e.g dragon, lucy, etc.)
- Reflection stack
- Phong shading, switch b/w ambient term & radiosity
- Texture-map triangles
- Load textures / lights from model files
